            Oh, her eyes, her eyes <br>
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'<br>
Her hair, her hair<br>
Falls perfectly without her tryin'<br>
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday<br>
Yeah, I know, I know<br>
When I compliment her, she won't believe me<br>
And it's so, it's so<br>
Sad to think that she don't see what I see<br>
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"<br>
I say<br>
When I see your face<br>
There's not a thing that I would change<br>
'Cause you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
And when you smile<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
Yeah<br>
Her lips, her lips<br>
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me<br>
Her laugh, her laugh<br>
She hates, but I think it's so sexy<br>
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday<br>
Oh, you know, you know<br>
You know I'd never ask you to change<br>
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same<br>
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay<br>
You know I'll say<br>
When I see your face<br>
There's not a thing that I would change<br>
'Cause you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
And when you smile<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
The way you are<br>
The way you are<br>
Girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
When I see your face<br>
There's not a thing that I would change<br>
'Cause you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
And when you smile<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
Yeah<br>
